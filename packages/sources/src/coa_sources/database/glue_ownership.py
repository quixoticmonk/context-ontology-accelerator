"""Namespace ownership checks for the Glue Data Catalog target of a source.

A Glue source names the database it catalogs — ``catalogId`` + ``databaseName``
— and those two values are the only thing deciding which data the discovery
connector reads, samples through Athena, and (in strict Lake Formation mode)
grants itself access to. ``manageSource`` authorizes the caller against the
NAMESPACE the source is created in; it says nothing about the database. Without
a check here, a steward in any namespace can point a source at any Glue database
in the platform account — including another namespace's managed federated
catalog, whose name is visible to that namespace's viewers via
``GetSource.athenaDataCatalogName`` — and read its schema, its column comments
and a sample of its values.

Two kinds of target, two different sources of truth:

* **Platform-provisioned catalogs** (``{sanitizedPrefix}ds_*``, minted by the
  federated-JDBC path). This deployment created them, so it knows who owns them:
  source-create writes a claim keyed by catalog name, and the claim is the
  owner. No other namespace may name one.
* **Everything else** — a native Glue database that already existed. Ownership
  is unknowable from here, so the DATA OWNER declares it by tagging the database
  ``{prefix}:namespace`` with the namespace(s) allowed to catalog it. The key and the
  value format are the shared ones — ``namespace_tag_key()`` and
  ``parse_namespace_tag()`` in ``coa_common.constants``, the same pair that binds a
  JDBC source's credential secret — so a space-separated list of namespace UUIDs,
  validated identically. ``ALL`` is a Glue-only addition on top: it is not a
  namespace id, so it is matched before the shared parser runs. An untagged database is not
  catalogable, which is the fail-closed direction: the platform never decides for
  itself that it may read data nobody handed it.

  Reading that tag needs ``glue:GetTags`` **and** ``glue:GetDatabase`` on the
  catalog — Glue authorizes the former against the latter, and without both the
  check fails closed and refuses every legitimate source. See the
  ``GlueOwnershipTagRead`` statement in the sources IAM policy
  (``infra-tf/modules/services/sources/iam.tf``).

Cross-account targets are exempt. Reaching them at all requires the customer's
own ``crossAccountRoleArn``, whose trust policy is the authorization, and their
Glue tags are theirs to set — not something this deployment can require.

The check runs at four points, because each is reachable without the others:
source-create (a 403 before anything is stored), the configuration-update guard
(the stored blob is discovery's input, so a repoint would bypass create),
``_discover`` (the last gate before the connector touches Glue and Athena), and
the federation provisioner (which holds Lake Formation admin, so it verifies
rather than assumes). Create is the one caller that tolerates a database which
does not exist yet — see ``allow_missing_database``.
