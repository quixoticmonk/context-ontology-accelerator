"""Namespace deletion Step Functions pipeline — Lambda task handlers.

Each module here is invoked as a Step Functions ``LambdaInvoke`` task. The
state machine definition lives in Terraform
(``infra-tf/modules/services/namespace/deletion_pipeline.tf``).

Pipeline order (see pipeline construct for the full state machine):
  1. delete_sources       — delete every source via the real sources-api
                             delete path (S3 / OpenSearch / DataZone / Glue
                             cleanup happens inside that Lambda, not here)
  2. delete_metrics       — bulk-delete every metric via the real
                             metric-api delete path (Neptune + OpenSearch)
  3. delete_ontology      — ontology-engine full teardown + S3 artifacts
  4. delete_platform      — VKG service, Athena workgroup, DataZone project,
                             role mappings, roles
  5. finalize             — delete namespace DDB record + name reservation,
                             status -> DELETED
  (any step failure -> mark_failed sets status -> DELETE_FAILED)
