def parse_referred_column(ref: str) -> tuple[str, str | None]:
    """Split a ``referredColumns`` entry into ``(target_table, target_column)``.

    The catalog reports an FK target as a dotted identifier whose LAST TWO
    segments are ``TABLE.COLUMN``. Everything before them is qualification
    (database, schema, catalog) and is dropped:

        ``"orders.order_id"``               → ``("orders", "order_id")``
        ``"public.orders.order_id"``        → ``("orders", "order_id")``
        ``"db.public.orders.order_id"``     → ``("orders", "order_id")``
        ``"orders"``                        → ``("orders", None)``

    A single-segment value carries no column, so the caller cannot build a
    join condition from it — ``build_r2rml`` treats that as a plain datatype
    column rather than emitting a bare ``rr:parentTriplesMap``, which would make
    Ontop produce a Cartesian product (R2RML §7.5).

    **This function does not validate; it splits.** A malformed reference yields an
    EMPTY half rather than an error, because only the caller knows what to do about
    it — the R2RML builder degrades the column to a datatype literal, while the
    subtype detector simply finds no parent:

        ``"x."``    → ``("x", "")``
        ``".y"``    → ``("", "y")``
        ``""``      → ``("", None)``

    So callers MUST test both halves for truthiness, not for ``None``. An empty
    table name is not ``None`` and reaches ``_parent_tmap`` as a name no in-run
    table answers to, which reads as an out-of-run target and mints
    ``TriplesMap_Entity`` (``to_pascal("")``) — a join to a TriplesMap that does not
    exist, which is the defect this consolidation set out to remove.

    This lives here, next to :class:`CatalogConstraint`, because the rule was
    previously re-implemented at six call sites under TWO INCOMPATIBLE
    conventions: ``parts[0]`` in the R2RML builder and the RIGOR topological sort,
    ``parts[-2]`` in the ontology builder, the SHACL config generator, the subtype
    detector, and the fingerprint normalizer. For a three-part reference the
    former yields the SCHEMA name, so the mapping pointed ``rr:parentTriplesMap``
    at a TriplesMap that does not exist while the ontology and shapes correctly
    referenced the table — the artifacts described different graphs.

    Args:
        ref: A ``referredColumns`` entry.

    Returns:
        ``(target_table, target_column)``; ``target_column`` is ``None`` when
        ``ref`` has no dot.

    # Only the trailing TABLE.COLUMN pair carries meaning; the leading
