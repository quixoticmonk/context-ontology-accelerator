    :func:`to_pascal` is lossy: it strips every character outside
    ``[a-zA-Z0-9\s_\-]``, treats space/underscore/hyphen as one separator
    class, and normalizes case. So ``order_item``, ``order-item``,
    ``Order_Item``, and ``ORDER ITEM`` all collapse onto ``OrderItem``, and any
    name made entirely of stripped characters collapses onto the ``"Entity"``
    fallback. Two tables in different databases can also share a bare name
    outright. Minting class / TriplesMap IRIs straight from ``to_pascal`` therefore
    silently FUSES distinct source tables onto one IRI: one class carrying both
    tables' labels, key axioms, and cardinality restrictions, and — worse — one
    TriplesMap carrying two ``rr:logicalTable`` / ``rr:tableName`` values, which
    is invalid R2RML (a TriplesMap has exactly one logical table). Ontop then
    either rejects the whole mapping (VKG load fails for the namespace) or picks
    one table non-deterministically and drops the other's data.

    This helper resolves collisions instead. Within a colliding set, ONE identity
    keeps the bare PascalCase form so existing single-table-per-name deployments
    mint byte-identical IRIs, and the others get ``{Pascal}_{sha256(identity)[:8]}``
    appended.

    Which one keeps the bare form is decided by ``min()`` over the identities, NOT
    by input order. Order would be the more obvious rule and is wrong here: the
    caller's list comes from ``_catalog_to_tables``, which flattens catalogs in
    whatever order Glue / OMD enumerated them and never sorts. Under an
    order-dependent rule, re-inducing the same schema after an enumeration change
    moves the bare name to a different table, so the IRIs in a newly generated
    mapping stop matching the ones in an already-accepted ontology — the exact
    divergence this helper exists to prevent. Keying on the identity instead makes
    the assignment a pure function of the schema.

    The result is reproducible across the ontology builder, the R2RML builder, and
    the SHACL config generator — all three must agree or the artifacts diverge.

    Callers should also surface a collision to the user (see the ``log.warning``
    below): a silent merge is the worst of the possible outcomes, and a schema
    that needs a discriminator usually indicates a naming problem worth fixing at
    the source.

    column. :meth:`InductionStrategy.build_r2rml` therefore emits a single POM,

    The ontology builder must know which columns those are. Declaring an
    ``owl:ObjectProperty`` per participating column (the obvious reading of the

    published TBox, in the class/property browser, and in the TBox context handed

    against a property Ontop cannot resolve to any column. The query compiles and
    returns nothing, with no mapping-gap signal in the logs. The gap scales with
    arity: a 3-column FK orphaned 2 properties.

    A MALFORMED composite FK (see :func:`composite_fk_is_usable`) behaves
    differently: ``build_r2rml`` gives every one of its columns a datatype
    ObjectMap, so none is absorbed — but none carries the relationship either, and
    the ontology must not declare any of them an object property. Those columns map

        and its object property. Empty when the table has no composite FK.

    Mirrors :meth:`InductionStrategy.build_r2rml`'s CONSUMING walk exactly, which
    matters when two composite FKs share a column. For ``FK1 = (a, b) -> p1`` and

    Each strategy takes table metadata and produces:
      - A proposal ontology graph (novel classes only)
      - A set of novel table names
      - A list of ConceptMatch results

    Each strategy also owns the R2RML mapping generation for its own
    ontology via :meth:`build_r2rml`. The default implementation
    reconstructs predicate IRIs from ``{table}_{col}`` naming which
    matches the ``table_to_ontology`` strategy's output. Strategies
    that generate class/property names via other means (e.g. LLM)
    should override :meth:`build_r2rml` to look up predicates from the
    generated graph.

        FK columns produce Referencing Object Maps (R2RML §7.5) using

        Non-FK columns produce datatype ObjectMaps with ``rr:column``.

        parseable URIs. We normalize here defensively.

        preserves names exactly as they appear in the source datasource --
        spaces, mixed case, reserved words, special chars -- so the SQL Ontop
        emits references the real columns without any reverse mapping.
        Class/property IRIs keep their readable PascalCase/camelCase form.
