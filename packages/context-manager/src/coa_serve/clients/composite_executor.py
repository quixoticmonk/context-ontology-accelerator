"""Composite Query Executor — single-vs-cross-source dispatch.

Implements the ``QueryExecutor`` protocol by routing each query to the
cheapest correct engine, per Serve LLD §2.2.1 Option D:

- **single-source, JDBC-backed** → ``SourceDBQueryExecutor`` (direct asyncpg,
  ~20-50ms p50)
- **cross-source / Glue-only / ambiguous** → ``AthenaQueryExecutor`` (federation,
  ~500-800ms p50)

The routing decision reuses the SQL Firewall's AST table extraction
(``SQLFirewall.extract_tables``) rather than re-parsing — exactly the
``unique_catalogs(...)`` heuristic the architecture note describes.

Graceful degradation (MVP safety): the direct-JDBC executor is OPTIONAL. When
it is not configured (no ``DATA_SOURCES_TABLE``, or it failed to build), the
composite delegates EVERY query to Athena — i.e. it behaves exactly like the
deployed Athena-only path. Wiring the composite therefore never regresses the
current behaviour; it only ADDS the direct-JDBC fast path when that executor is
available. Authorization is unchanged — both underlying executors run the SQL
Firewall ``validate()`` themselves, and data-level ``evaluate()`` already ran in
the caller (Tier-1 orchestrator / Tier-2 VKGTranslator) before dispatch.
