"""Unit tests for Tier 1 MetricResolver — in-memory metric cache.

Tests cover:
- Index building from seed data
- Exact name matching (case-insensitive substring)
- Synonym matching (word-boundary regex)
- Multi-metric detection
- Namespace filtering
- Lookup by ID
- list_all() compact summaries
- Background refresh lifecycle
- Neptune load (mocked)
- match() exact-then-fuzzy interface
- Fuzzy near-miss matching + dimension substitution (branch additions)
