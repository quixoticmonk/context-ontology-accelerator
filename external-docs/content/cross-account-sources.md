# Cross-Account Data Sources

How to onboard a **JDBC database** or **Glue Data Catalog** that lives in a
*different AWS account* than your Context Ontology Accelerator deployment. The data owner (the account
holding the database/catalog) grants Context Ontology Accelerator narrowly-scoped access; Context Ontology Accelerator never
requires admin in the owner's account.

> `{prefix}` is the deployment prefix `{project}-{env}` (e.g. `accelerator-dev`).
> `<accelerator-account>` is the account where Context Ontology Accelerator is deployed; `<owner-account>`
> holds the data source.

There are three independent concerns. Set up only the ones your source needs:

| Concern | JDBC | Glue |
|---|---|---|
| **Network** — reach the DB host | ✅ Required | — (Glue/Athena APIs are regional, no VPC path) |
| **Credentials** — read the Secrets Manager secret | ✅ Required | — |
| **Catalog authorization** — read table metadata | — | ✅ Required (IAM and/or Lake Formation) |

---

## Cross-Account JDBC

### 1. Network connectivity

The discovery connector and federated-query connector run inside Context Ontology Accelerator's VPC and
must reach the database host. Establish a private path (VPC peering, Transit
Gateway, or PrivateLink) and open the DB security group to Context Ontology Accelerator's connector
security group on the engine port. See
"Cross-Network Connectivity" section below for the full
peering/TGW walkthrough — it is the same regardless of account boundary.

### 2. Share the credential secret

The secret holding `username`/`password` lives in the owner account. **Three**
roles in the Context Ontology Accelerator account must be able to read it:

- `{prefix}-sources-db-connector` — discovery
- `{prefix}-federated-catalog-role` — the managed Athena connector (federated query)
- The **serve runtime role** — the Context Manager's own role, used by the
  direct-JDBC fast path (a single-source query routes to a direct `asyncpg`
  connection instead of Athena federation for lower latency; see
  [Serve](serve.md#resolution-tiers)). This path fetches the secret directly
  with the serve runtime's own credentials, bypassing Athena and the
  federated-catalog-role entirely. **Missing this grant doesn't break the
  source outright** — discovery and Athena-routed queries still work — it
  only fails the subset of queries the composite executor routes to the
  direct-JDBC path, which looks like an intermittent bug rather than a clear
  permissions error. Resolve its ARN from SSM in the Context Ontology Accelerator
  account:

  ```bash
  aws ssm get-parameter --name "/{prefix}/serve/runtime-role-arn" \
    --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text
  ```

**a. Secret resource policy** (in the owner account):

```bash
aws secretsmanager put-resource-policy \
  --secret-id "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<owner-account>:secret:db/prod-XXXX" \
  --resource-policy '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "AWS": [
        "arn:aws:iam::<accelerator-account>:role/{prefix}-sources-db-connector",
        "arn:aws:iam::<accelerator-account>:role/{prefix}-federated-catalog-role",
        "<serve-runtime-role-arn-from-ssm-above>"
      ]},
      "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
      "Resource": "*"
    }]
  }'
```

**b. KMS key policy** — if the secret is encrypted with a customer-managed key,
add all three role ARNs to the key policy with `kms:Decrypt` (Context Ontology Accelerator's roles
already scope their KMS use to `kms:ViaService = secretsmanager.*`).

!!! note "No `<prefix>:namespace` tag needed cross-account"
    The `<prefix>:namespace` tag that in-account credential secrets must carry (see
    [Data Sources](sources.md)) does **not** apply to a cross-account secret —
    the accelerator does not own the owner account and cannot tag its secrets.
    Authorization here comes entirely from the secret's resource policy above
    (and the KMS key policy). The registration-time namespace-binding check
    detects that the secret ARN is in a different account and skips the tag
    requirement accordingly.

### 3. Register the source

Pass the owner-account secret ARN. No `crossAccountRoleArn` is needed when the
secret resource policy grants Context Ontology Accelerator's roles directly (recommended). Use
`crossAccountRoleArn` only if your security model requires Context Ontology Accelerator to assume a role
in the owner account to reach the secret.

```json
{
  "sourceType": "DATABASE",
  "name": "partner-postgres",
  "databaseSource": {
    "jdbcConfiguration": {
      "engine": "POSTGRESQL",
      "host": "db.cluster-xyz.<region>.rds.amazonaws.com",
      "port": 5432,
      "databaseName": "analytics",
      "credentialSecretArn": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<owner-account>:secret:db/prod-XXXX",
      "crossAccountRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<owner-account>:role/{prefix}-datasource-access-secret-role"
    }
  }
}
```

If you use `crossAccountRoleArn`, that role's trust policy must allow the
`{prefix}-sources-db-connector` role to assume it, and its permissions must allow
`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` (and `kms:Decrypt` if applicable) on the secret.

!!! important "The trust policy must require an ExternalId"
    Every cross-account assume presents an **ExternalId derived from the namespace
    the source belongs to**: `{prefix}-{env}-{namespaceId}`. The value is computed
    server-side and is **not** accepted from the API request — that is what stops a
    caller who can create sources in one namespace from pointing a source at a role
    onboarded for a different namespace and reading its data.

    Condition your trust policy on that exact value. An assume with no ExternalId
    is denied by the platform's own IAM policy, so a role whose trust policy omits
    the condition is assumable by any namespace in the deployment — the condition
    is what makes the trust policy an authorization list.

    ```json
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::<coa-account>:role/{prefix}-{env}-sources-db-connector",
          "arn:aws:iam::<coa-account>:role/{prefix}-{env}-sources-db-enrichment-agent"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": { "sts:ExternalId": "{prefix}-{env}-{namespaceId}" }
      }
    }
    ```

    `tests/cdk/lib/datasource-access-role.ts` builds this for you — pass
    `-c namespace_id=<namespaceId>` and it derives the same value.

    **Existing sources:** a source onboarded before this control keeps using the
    `externalId` stored on its record, so nothing breaks. New sources ignore any
    `externalId` in the request. To migrate one, update the trust policy to the
    derived value above and re-register the source.

!!! note "Role naming convention is a web-app-only guardrail"
    The example above sends `crossAccountRoleArn`. The role name must
    contain `{prefix}-datasource-access-` (e.g. `{prefix}-datasource-access-{customer}`).
    This is enforced in the Connect Source form, not by the API — the backing
    control is the platform's `sts:AssumeRole` policy, which only matches
    `*-datasource-access-*` names.

---

## Cross-Account Glue Data Catalog

Glue access has no network component — it's authorized by IAM and, when enabled,
Lake Formation.

!!! important "`crossAccountRoleArn` covers discovery, not querying"
    Cross-account Glue access happens at **two distinct stages**, governed
    differently:

>   - **Discovery (metadata)** — the discovery connector
      (`{prefix}-sources-db-connector`) **assumes `crossAccountRoleArn`** and
      calls `glue:GetDatabase`/`GetTables` as a principal in the owner account.
      Supplying the role is sufficient to scan a source successfully (tables and
      columns appear).
>   - **Query (data)** — Amazon Athena runs as the Context Ontology Accelerator **serve runtime role**
      and does **not** assume `crossAccountRoleArn`. Cross-account querying
      requires native AWS sharing: the owner shares the catalog
      (Glue resource policy / AWS RAM) and, if LF-governed, grants the serve
      runtime role `SELECT`/`DESCRIBE` (LF grants flow through RAM).

>   A source can therefore scan and show metadata while still being
    **non-queryable** until the catalog is shared with — and LF-granted to — the
    serve runtime role. Complete both the discovery role *and* the
    query-time sharing below for end-to-end access.

Determine which mode the owner's catalog uses:

```bash
# Run in the OWNER account. Empty CreateDatabaseDefaultPermissions ⇒ strict-LF.
aws lakeformation get-data-lake-settings \
  --query 'DataLakeSettings.CreateDatabaseDefaultPermissions'
```

- Non-empty (contains `ALL` for `IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS`) → **IAM-mode**
- Empty → **strict Lake Formation mode**

### 1. Register the source

```json
{
  "sourceType": "DATABASE",
  "name": "partner-lake",
  "databaseSource": {
    "glueConfiguration": {
      "databaseName": "hcp360",
      "region": "<region>",
      "catalogId": "<owner-account>"
    }
  }
}
```

`catalogId` set to the owner account ID tells Context Ontology Accelerator the catalog is cross-account.

### 2. Grant Context Ontology Accelerator catalog access (owner account)

Two Context Ontology Accelerator-side roles must be authorized — the **discovery connector**
(`{prefix}-sources-db-connector`, reads metadata) and the **serve runtime**
(queries data via Athena). Grant both for end-to-end access.

**IAM-mode** — a cross-account Glue catalog resource policy authorizes the
metadata reads. Include **both** roles so discovery *and* Athena query work:

```bash
# In the OWNER account
aws glue put-resource-policy --policy-in-json '{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": { "AWS": [
      "arn:aws:iam::<accelerator-account>:role/{prefix}-sources-db-connector",
      "arn:aws:iam::<accelerator-account>:role/<serve-runtime-role>"
    ]},
    "Action": ["glue:GetDatabase","glue:GetDatabases","glue:GetTable","glue:GetTables","glue:GetPartitions"],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:glue:<region>:<owner-account>:catalog",
      "arn:aws:glue:<region>:<owner-account>:database/hcp360",
      "arn:aws:glue:<region>:<owner-account>:table/hcp360/*"
    ]
  }]
}'
```

For **query-time** in IAM-mode, Athena also needs the catalog shared via AWS RAM
(and the underlying S3 data readable by the serve runtime role). A Glue resource
policy alone authorizes the API calls but Athena's cross-account catalog
resolution relies on the RAM share:

```bash
# In the OWNER account — share the database (and its tables) with the Context Ontology Accelerator account
aws ram create-resource-share --name accelerator-hcp360 \
  --resource-arns arn:aws:glue:<region>:<owner-account>:database/hcp360 \
  --principals <accelerator-account>
```

**Strict-LF mode** — additionally grant Lake Formation permissions. Context Ontology Accelerator
**cannot** self-grant across accounts (it is not an LF admin in the owner
account), so these grants are a required prerequisite. The first two grants
enable **discovery**; the third enables **querying**:

```bash
# In the OWNER account, as a Lake Formation admin
# Discovery connector — DESCRIBE on database + tables
aws lakeformation grant-permissions \
  --principal DataLakePrincipalIdentifier=arn:aws:iam::<accelerator-account>:role/{prefix}-sources-db-connector \
  --resource '{"Database":{"Name":"hcp360"}}' --permissions DESCRIBE
aws lakeformation grant-permissions \
  --principal DataLakePrincipalIdentifier=arn:aws:iam::<accelerator-account>:role/{prefix}-sources-db-connector \
  --resource '{"Table":{"DatabaseName":"hcp360","TableWildcard":{}}}' --permissions DESCRIBE

# Serve runtime — SELECT/DESCRIBE so Athena can query the data (query-time)
aws lakeformation grant-permissions \
  --principal DataLakePrincipalIdentifier=arn:aws:iam::<accelerator-account>:role/<serve-runtime-role> \
  --resource '{"Table":{"DatabaseName":"hcp360","TableWildcard":{}}}' --permissions SELECT DESCRIBE
```

Resolve the serve runtime role ARN from SSM in the Context Ontology Accelerator account:

```bash
aws ssm get-parameter --name "/{prefix}/serve/runtime-role-arn" \
  --query 'Parameter.Value' --output text
```

> If you onboard and the connection fails with a Lake Formation authorization
> error, the scan-job `errorMessage` returns the exact `grant-permissions`
> commands to run (including the resolved role ARNs). Run them in the owner
> account, then re-scan.

### 3. Enable cross-account querying (resource link)

The owner-side grants above let the source **scan** (discovery succeeds), but
Athena in the Context Ontology Accelerator account cannot query a database that only exists in the
owner's catalog. Cross-account Athena querying requires a **resource link** — a
local Glue database in the Context Ontology Accelerator account that points at the shared owner
database. Athena queries the resource-link name, not the original database.

Do this once per cross-account database, in the **Context Ontology Accelerator account**, as a Lake
Formation admin:

```bash
# 1. Accept the RAM share from the owner (automatic if both accounts are in the
#    same AWS Organization with resource sharing enabled; otherwise accept the
#    invitation explicitly).
aws ram get-resource-share-invitations \
  --query "resourceShareInvitations[?senderAccountId=='<owner-account>']"
aws ram accept-resource-share-invitation --resource-share-invitation-arn <invitation-arn>

# 2. Create a resource link pointing at the shared owner database.
aws glue create-database --catalog-id <accelerator-account> --database-input '{
  "Name": "hcp360_link",
  "TargetDatabase": { "CatalogId": "<owner-account>", "DatabaseName": "hcp360" }
}'

# 3. Grant the serve runtime role DESCRIBE on the LOCAL resource link
#    (in addition to the cross-account SELECT/DESCRIBE granted by the owner above).
aws lakeformation grant-permissions \
  --principal DataLakePrincipalIdentifier=arn:aws:iam::<accelerator-account>:role/<serve-runtime-role> \
  --resource '{"Database":{"CatalogId":"<accelerator-account>","Name":"hcp360_link"}}' \
  --permissions DESCRIBE
```

Athena then queries the resource link:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "AwsDataCatalog"."hcp360_link"."patients" LIMIT 100;
```

!!! warning "Context Ontology Accelerator does not automate cross-account query setup"
    Context Ontology Accelerator's automatic serve-role grant
    (`grant_consumer_select_native`) targets **only the Context Ontology Accelerator account's own
    catalog** (`CatalogId = <accelerator-account>`) and does **not** create resource
    links. It self-heals same-account strict-LF sources but performs no
    cross-account grant or resource-link creation. For cross-account Glue, steps
    1–3 above are a manual prerequisite (owner-side LF grant + RAM accept +
    resource link + local DESCRIBE). This is a known limitation; cross-account
    discovery works via `crossAccountRoleArn`, but cross-account *querying* must
    be wired up manually.

---

## IAM-mode vs Lake Formation mode (same-account note)

For **same-account** catalogs Context Ontology Accelerator self-heals: in strict-LF mode the discovery
connector transiently assumes the LF-admin grantor role
(`{prefix}-sources-federation-provisioner`) and grants itself `DESCRIBE`, so
no manual grant is needed. This self-heal only works same-account — the grantor
is not an admin in other accounts, which is why cross-account requires the
explicit owner-side grants above.

---

## Quick checklist

**Cross-account JDBC**

- [ ] Private network path established; DB SG opens engine port to `{prefix}-connector-sg`
- [ ] Secret resource policy grants `{prefix}-sources-db-connector` + `{prefix}-federated-catalog-role` + the serve runtime role (`/{prefix}/serve/runtime-role-arn` in SSM)
- [ ] KMS key policy grants `kms:Decrypt` to those three roles (CMK-encrypted secrets only)
- [ ] Source registered with owner-account `credentialSecretArn`

**Cross-account Glue**

- [ ] `catalogId` set to the owner account ID
- [ ] **Discovery:** Glue resource policy grants `glue:Get*` to `{prefix}-sources-db-connector` (+ strict-LF: LF `DESCRIBE` to the connector)
- [ ] **Query-time (owner account):** catalog shared via AWS RAM; serve runtime role can read the underlying S3 data (+ strict-LF: LF `SELECT`/`DESCRIBE` to the serve runtime role)
- [ ] **Query-time (Context Ontology Accelerator account):** RAM share accepted; resource link created pointing at the owner DB; serve runtime role granted `DESCRIBE` on the resource link

> `crossAccountRoleArn` only covers discovery. A source can scan and show
> metadata yet remain non-queryable until the query-time rows above are
> complete. Context Ontology Accelerator does not automate cross-account query setup — it is a manual
> prerequisite.

See [Structured Data Source Guide](index.md) for registration, scanning, review,
and querying once access is in place.

# Cross-Network Connectivity

How to establish network connectivity between the Context Ontology Accelerator platform and databases in a separate VPC or account.

> The connectors are routing-agnostic (a plain TCP connection to `host:port`), so **no application change** is needed — only the network plumbing below.

## Scenarios

| Situation | Connectivity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DBs in Context Ontology Accelerator's VPC | None needed | Deploy test stack with `vpc_id`=Context Ontology Accelerator VPC |
| DBs in a separate VPC (same account) | VPC Peering or Transit Gateway | Deploy test stack first, then set the `jdbc_peer_*` variables in Context Ontology Accelerator's `shared.tfvars` |
| DBs in a separate account | VPC Peering/TGW + cross-account role | As above + `CustomerAccessStack` |

## Same-VPC (No Cross-Network)

> **Note:** The `tests/cdk` directory referenced below is an internal integration-test stack and is not included in the public mirror. The patterns shown here illustrate how to deploy companion test databases; adapt them to your own infrastructure code.

Simplest path. Deploy the test databases into Context Ontology Accelerator's VPC:

```bash
cd tests/cdk
npx cdk deploy coa-integ-test-databases \
  -c vpc_id=<accelerator-vpc-id> \
  -c connector_security_group_id=<accelerator-connector-sg-id>
```

The DB security group allows the VPC CIDR, so the discovery Lambda can reach the DBs directly.

## Separate-VPC Peering

Cross-network peering is two-sided. Deploy order: test stack → Context Ontology Accelerator → finish peer side.

### 1. Deploy the test stack in its own VPC

```bash
cd tests/cdk && npx cdk deploy coa-integ-test-databases
```

Capture: test VPC ID, VPC CIDR from stack outputs.

### 2. Deploy Context Ontology Accelerator with peering variables

Set the peering variables in `infra-tf/shared.tfvars`:

```hcl
jdbc_peer_vpc_id = "<test-vpc-id>"
jdbc_peer_cidrs  = ["<test-vpc-cidr>"]
```

For cross-account peers, also set:

```hcl
jdbc_peer_owner_id = "<account-id>"
jdbc_peer_region   = "<region>"   # required only for cross-region
```

Then apply:

```bash
cd infra-tf && make apply-00-network
```

### 3. Finish the peer (test-DB) side

> **CI note:** The `configure-peering` job in `ci/mainline.yml` automates this step via `tests/cdk/scripts/connect-cross-network.sh`. The manual steps below are for ad-hoc deployments.

1. **Accept** the peering connection:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 accept-vpc-peering-connection --vpc-peering-connection-id <pcx-id>
   ```

2. **Add return routes** in the test VPC's private route tables — destination = Context Ontology Accelerator's private-subnet CIDRs, target = peering connection.

3. **Open the DB security group** for inbound DB ports from Context Ontology Accelerator's CIDRs:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <test-db-sg> \
     --protocol tcp --port 5432 --cidr <accelerator-private-cidr>
   ```

4. Ensure the DB hostname resolves from Context Ontology Accelerator's VPC (enable DNS resolution on the peering connection).

## Alternatives to Peering

### Transit Gateway

Best for many-VPC fan-out. In `infra-tf/shared.tfvars`:

```hcl
jdbc_tgw_id    = "<tgw-id>"
jdbc_tgw_cidrs = ["<test-cidr>"]
```

Apply, then attach the test VPC to the same TGW and add route-table entries both ways.

### PrivateLink

Tolerates overlapping CIDRs — no route/CIDR coordination needed. In `infra-tf/shared.tfvars`:

```hcl
jdbc_privatelink_service      = "<svc-name>"
jdbc_privatelink_port         = <port>
jdbc_privatelink_private_dns  = true   # optional
```

Requires the test side to expose the DB behind an NLB + VPC endpoint service.

## Terraform variable reference

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `jdbc_peer_vpc_id` | Peer VPC to connect to (enables peering) |
| `jdbc_peer_cidrs` | List of CIDRs in the peer network to route to |
| `jdbc_peer_owner_id` | Peer account ID (cross-account peering) |
| `jdbc_peer_region` | Peer region (cross-region peering) |
| `jdbc_tgw_id` | Existing Transit Gateway ID to attach to |
| `jdbc_tgw_cidrs` | List of CIDRs reachable via the TGW |
| `jdbc_privatelink_service` | Producer endpoint-service name |
| `jdbc_privatelink_port` | DB port the endpoint service listens on |
| `jdbc_privatelink_private_dns` | `true` to enable private DNS on the endpoint |

These variables apply only when Context Ontology Accelerator creates its own VPC (no `vpc_id` set). Imported VPCs are expected to bring their own connectivity.
